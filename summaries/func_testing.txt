Functional testing, in general, is highly dependent upon the various functional 
requirements included in the project plan. As such, the plan is to have a test 
for those requirements that are more likely to produce errors when faced with a
user. For instance, while a title is required for this project, it has a low chance 
of failing to appear to the user. Therefore, testing resources (i.e. time) would
be better spent on a requirement like tracking a user request for the number of players.

Once again, this type of testing determines if the actions performed when running
this program are in accordance with the requirements set prior to development. With
the combination of unit testing and integration testing, the only action-wise testing
left to be completed pertains specifically to the functions required to make Yahtzee
run correctly.
